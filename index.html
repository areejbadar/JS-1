<p>alert("")</p>
<h3>Prompt</h3>
<p>prompt("")</p>
<h4>Random Number</h4>
<p>We can do it in the console and see the result appear if we log it:
    console.log(Math.random());
    This number will be a decimal between 0 and 1. If we want a number between 0 and
    100, we can multiply it by 100, like this:
    console.log(Math.random() * 100);</p>
